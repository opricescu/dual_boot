# dual_boot
dual_boot_windows10_ubuntu

Situation: 

After I decided to install a Ubuntu on my pc and I did a dual boot, I found that if window 10 updates, it does not manage to take into account the settings made with for the boot manager grub.
I reset the settings manually, but at the next update I encountered the same problem and then I decided to make a bash to help me solve my problem quickly.

What he does:

It opens the diskpart, lists the disks, helps you map your drive where the boot file is and if you did not change anything when you installed the grub manager, itâ€™s backup your current boot file of windows and replaces it whit the grub manager file. After it finishes, it removes the driver.

Beware - an administrator instance is required and the changes are not reversible
